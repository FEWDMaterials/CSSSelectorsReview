# Class Selectors

Please update styles to have the markup appear like the image 
-- in this case we added an ID attribute to the verse that is 
the chorus (and called it bridge)

hints:

the space to the left of all the text is 20 pixels
the bridge font is 16 pixels
use common color names and NOT hex or rgb
Helvetica is the font used
